# Computer Vision
This repository mainly record the code of EQ2425 *Analysis and Search of Visual Data* Projects.
We mainly used openCV-Python to do the job. Maybe implement those tasks in Matlab later.
## Project I
- Feature detection by SIFT and SURF
- Test the robustness after image transformation
- Feature matching
## Project II
This project is basically to implement the algorithm proposed by Josef, Andrew in ***A Text Retrieval Approach to Object Matching in Videos***. More details can be found in ***Mobile Visual Search*** by Giord .etc

- Image Feature extraction
  - Traverse images in folders
  - extract the object index by regular expression filter
  - store all the feature in a text file
- Constract vocabulary tree
