# Computer Vision
This repository mainly record the code of EQ2425 *Analysis and Search of Visual Data* Projects.
We mainly used openCV-Python to do the job. Maybe implement those tasks in Matlab later.
## Project I
- Feature detection by SIFT and SURF
- Test the robustness after image transformation
- Feature matching
## Project II
- Traverse images in folders
- extract the object index by regular expression filter
- store all the feature in a text file
